==========

A light webapp to display various words, terms, and expressions from the Cocoa ecosystem.

The real mastermind behind this project is [thenickperson](http://github.com/thenickperson). His project [buzzword-generator](http://thenickperson.com/buzzword-generator) inspired me to refactor the existing base to be more Cocoa-like. 

Think I'm missing some Cocoa terminology? Go ahead and [fork the project](http://github.com/piperchester/cocoa-buzz/fork) to submit your words.
